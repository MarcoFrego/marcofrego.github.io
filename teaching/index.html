    <h1>Foundations of Computer Science and Numerical Methods</h1>
    <p>
        I have been the lecturer for the laboratory on numerical methods.
        The students were introduced to computer programming
        and taught how to implement numerical methods in Ruby.
        The course was offered to the students from the B.Sc. of Industrial Engineering.
    </p>
    <p>Lectures consisted of theory (slides), examples (live coding),
        and exercises (students coding and then discussion of the solution).
        All materials are made available at this <a href="cnum.html">page</a>
        ordered by lecture date.</p>
